Fetch BTC through coinmarketcap API, using an API key. 
Display the price and a graph of price changes. 
Modified version of: https://github.com/VolosR/bitCoinTTGO As that project does not handle API keys and uses an API which is no longer functioning. 

Just change the SSID, Password & API Key to connect to coinmaarketcap
Also add orb.h and frame.h to the project by going to Sketch > Add file
